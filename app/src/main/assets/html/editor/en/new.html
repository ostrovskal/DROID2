        <h1>Creation of the planet</h1>
        <p>During creation of the new planet, it is necessary to set several parameters.
        <p>Contents of planets are formed in a random way, on a certain algorithm. To influence this process,
            it is necessary to choose filling type in the list of this window. This type will create advantage in filling with a certain element.
            Is <c val="#ffffff">6</c>  filling options:
        <p><img src="main,T_NULL"><img src="main,T_EARTH"><img src="main,T_BETON"><img src="main,T_STONE"><img src="main,T_EGG"><img src="main,T_BOMB">
        <p><img src="main,T_DROIDR"> it will be established at the very beginning of the planet. After generation, when editing,
            it is necessary to make changes for realization <big>of sense</big> this planet.
            Generation of the planet - <big>preparation, no more than that</big>
        <p>Following a stage, it is necessary to define system in which the planet will be placed. Or to create new - we choose "..." also we set a system name.
            The name has to be unique and not be crossed with other systems installed on the device. The system is by default chosen,
            chosen in the previous time or set in installations of a game.

        <h5>Characteristic of the planet</h5>
        <p>Further on the screen of creation of the planet we set the following parameters:
        <p><big>number</big> - a position in system. It is necessary for definition of what planet follows another.
        <p><big>a name</big> - a unique name. It shouldn't be crossed with other names of planets in the chosen system.
        <p><big>fuel</big> - the volume of fuel which in your opinion will be enough for the droid for release of the planet.
        <p><big>time</big> - necessary time for which it is necessary to manage to free the planet.
        <p><big>height</big> and <big>width</big> - planet dimensions set.
        <p>After introduction of these sizes and their check on correctness, the editor will create
            for you this planet will also be passed into the editing mode, see <a href="editing">by Editing</a>
        <p>By the way, you need to know that empty systems in which there is no planet at start of a game, automatically are removed...
