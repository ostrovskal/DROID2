        <h1>Editing</h1>
        <h5>editing Elements</h5>
        <p><img src="editor_panel">
        <p> For a choice of an element of editing it is necessary to click it in a panel.
            The selected element will be selected with the frame. I.e. the frame shows what element is the active.
        <p>All elements of editing settle down in three lines / a column (depending on orientation of the device) on a panel.
            Each of them makes the following sense:
        <p>1. <big>surrounding</big>
        <p>2. <big>stock</big>
        <p>3. <big>of a being</big>
        <p>All these elements are described in the help information on a game.
        <h5>Installation of an element</h5>
        <p>After separation of the required element, it can be set on the planet.
        <p>Ð”For this purpose it is necessary to click the point interesting you and the element will be written in it.
            If not to release contact from the screen and its message - the element will be placed in all line items of the planet, corresponding to contact points.
        <p>If on a panel it is selected a <big>element of a being</big>, then installation of an element becomes complicated a little.
        <p>If it is selected by <img src="main,T_DROIDR">, then the previous line item of the droid will be erased (if was)
            and replaced with current position of contact, with restoration of that element,
            which was under it before contact. I.e. the planet can have a droid only of <big>one!</big>.
        <p>If in a contact line item, there is already a droid - there will be a changeover of his direction, see below. In a consequence in case of start of the planet in a game,
            at first that part of the planet where it was set by <img src="main,T_DROIDR"> will be shown
        <p>If it is selected by <img src="main,T_EYEG">, then installation of an element on the same element on the planet will lead to changeover it on
            <img src="main,T_EYEB"> and vice versa.
        <p>In case of installation of other beings, the principle such. Each being has four directions of movement, for example
            <img src="main,T_YELLOWD"><img src="main,T_YELLOWL"><img src="main,T_YELLOWU"><img src="main,T_YELLOWR">. Therefore to involve this mechanism,
            it is necessary to set an element of a being, on same in a point of contact and then, the element with an increment in the direction will be set.
        <h5>Navigation</h5>
        <p>If only the part of the planet is displayed, it is possible to change this visible part. For this purpose it is necessary to use so-called <big>long click</big>
        <p>Having clicked on an every spot on the globe and retaining contact certain time (without moving a finger) the editor will pass into the shift <big>mode</big>.
            This mode will visually be designated by display blackening. Without releasing contact move it in the necessary napraleniye - the planet will move.
            In case of release the editor will return to a former status again.
        <p>For an output from the editor press <big>back button</big> on the device. If the planet was changed,
            that, the editor will ask you about need of saving changes.
