    <ul>
        <li>The planet can be freed only at extermination of all monsters and gathering all eggs. As soon as possible collect eggs,
            since from them other monsters can hatch. Be careful at the same time not to run into the hatched monster.
            Process of hatching is followed by <b>trembling</b> eggs</li>
        <li>Destroy monsters using make-shifts <img src="main,TILE_BOMB"> or <img src="main,TILE_STONE">
            On bombs perish <img src="main,TILE_YELLOWD">. Drop stones and bombs on beings.</li>
        <li>For faster accumulation of experience, it is better to use the bombs. At explosion of such bombs, everything that will get to epicenter has double effect.
            This condition is also satisfied at initiation of chain reaction of explosion. In a consequence it can positively affect your rating

        <li>Sometimes in a game there are situations at which the droid can't make anything for release of the planet.
            For example, I have got stuck among stones or bombs have ended,
            and monsters can be killed only with them.
